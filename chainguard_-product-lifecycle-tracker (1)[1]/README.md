Decentralized Product Ledger • Blockchain + AI Manufacturing Flow

Phase 1 of the system is responsible for creating the source of truth for every product manufactured.
This component writes all product lifecycle events to the Ethereum Sepolia blockchain, attaches metadata stored on IPFS, and prepares a universal JSON payload for Phase 2 (PC-2).

📌 Overview

The Phase-1 Manufacturing Bot acts as the blockchain writer in the end-to-end return/refund automation system.

Its responsibilities include:

Generating a unique product ID

Generating and uploading product metadata to IPFS

Deploying (or connecting to) the ProductLedger smart contract

Writing lifecycle events to the Ethereum blockchain

Generating a secure JSON payload for Phase-2 (Refund Validator Bot)

This bot ensures tamper-proof product identity, creating a decentralized record from:

Factory → Warehouse → Retail Store
