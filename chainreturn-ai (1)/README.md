Decentralized Return Verification • AI + Blockchain + Supply Chain Intelligence

Phase 2 of the system is responsible for reading blockchain data generated in Phase 1 and automatically determining whether a returned product is valid, legitimate, and eligible for a refund.

This component acts as the refund decision engine, ensuring end-to-end transparency and trust in the return workflow.

📌 Overview

This bot receives the JSON payload from Phase-1 (PC-1), connects to the same smart contract on the Ethereum Sepolia blockchain, fetches all product lifecycle history, and applies refund validation logic to determine:

Authenticity of the product

Validity of metadata (IPFS)

Legitimacy of ownership transfers

Correctness of status updates

Eligibility for refund based on lifecycle and rules

This creates a fully decentralized supply-chain + returns system.
